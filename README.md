# Smart Camera System for Automobiles

Our project deals to employ a SMART CAMERA SYSTEM for road
navigation and set a new norm for Driver safety standards. This change in
driving an automobile will not only make driving much more easier for newer
generation but also a safe experience.

### Objectives

• The main objective of Smart Camera System is to define video
tracking features and varied systems needed to perform object
tracking.

• Several Image Processing Algorithms need to be developed and used
for video tracking purposes. OpenCV is one such module in Python
that helps with image processing techniques in programming.

• Once video tracking occurs, we can implement the AI part of the
project where we will use several meand to detect objects, faces and states
